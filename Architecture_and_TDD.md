# Architecture and TDD in Laravel-Vue Application
##Introduction
This report provides an overview of the architecture of our Laravel-Vue application and describes how we implemented Test-Driven Development (TDD) during its development. The key decisions made during design and development are detailed, as well as the processes and tools used to ensure the quality of the code and the robustness of the application.
## Application Architecture
Our application follows a client-server architecture, where the backend is developed with Laravel and the frontend with Vue.js. The main components of each part are described below:

## Backend (Laravel)
Controllers: Used to handle HTTP requests and orchestrate business logic.
Models: They represent data structures and define the relationships between them.
Routes: Define URLs and associated handlers to handle incoming requests.
Middleware: Used to filter and modify HTTP requests before they reach the controllers.
## Interface (Vue.js)
Components: Independent units of the user interface that can be reused throughout the application.
Routes: Defined using Vue Router to manage navigation between different views of the application.
Application State: Managed through Vuex to maintain a centralized and shared state between components.

## TDD implementation
During the development of our application, we follow a TDD approach to ensure code quality and system stability. Here are the key steps we follow: Writing Tests: Before writing code, we write automated tests that describe the expected behavior of new features or functionality.
Test Execution: We run the tests to verify what crashed initially, confirming that we are testing the correct behavior.
Code Implementation: We write the minimum code necessary for the tests to pass.
Refactoring: Once the tests pass, we refactor the code to improve its quality and readability, keeping the tests as a safety net to avoid regressions.
Key Decisions and Challenges.

During development, we faced several challenges and made key decisions that will affect the architecture and implementation of the application. Some of these decisions include: Choosing Laravel and Vue.js as core technologies due to their maturity, active community, and rapid development capabilities.
Implemented token based authentication using JWT for API security.
Integration of testing tools like PHPUnit and Jest to write and execute unit and integration tests on the backend and frontend respectively.

### Conclusions
The combination of a well-defined architecture and the practice of TDD has been fundamental for this project. It has allowed us to develop a robust and scalable application, with a high level of reliability and maintainability.
